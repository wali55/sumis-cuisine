#### About The App

* This is a blog recipe app I have created for my mother which showcases my mother's recipes.
* Users can see all the recipes in card view and by clicking on the card users can see the detailed recipe and also watch the video of the recipe.
* For the backend Node JS and Express JS are used and data is stored in the MongoDB.
* I am also planning to add authentication for the users and also admin functionality so that my mother can fill up a form and create a blog recipe article and also update and delete an article.
